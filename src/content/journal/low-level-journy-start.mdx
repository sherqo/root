I used to be all about AI, SaaS, and Full Stack Web Dev. I loved building stuff and exploring new frameworks, but one day I saw a post on X by [@lauriewired](https://x.com/lauriewired) that changed my direction:

> _if you’re a CS/EE student, write your thesis on JIT compilation of eBPF for NVMe controllers. there’s huge career alpha in computational storage; the standards are just starting to exist (TP4091)_  
> [source](https://x.com/lauriewired/status/2016593481440121265)

At first, it soundes, like..., insane. JIT compilation? eBPF? NVMe? I didn’t know what are these. But the more I read, the more I realized that **this is the kind of hardcore, under-explored stuff that actually can change a future and the way I think**. That’s when I decided to pivot.

I started by refreshing my C skills - I already had some experience from embedded systems and playing with basic OS concepts in university courses, mainly from _The C Programming Language_ (K&R). Alongside C, I’ve been diving into Linux kernel internals to really understand how things work under the hood. I’ve already messed around with kernels a bit on my Arch setup (I broke it a lot).

I think it’s messy, hard, and slow, but I love it.

I will try to keep you updated. _Hopefully :)_
